## Summary 

BlocJams was my first project here at Bloc. I was excited to finally build my first app with my newly found skills, which were a languages such as: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. During the project, I was introduced to many different aspects to building an app such as, why write a piece of code this way, how can we refactor our current code, or how dynamic do we want this particular feautre to be. All in all while working on BlocJams, I learned many essential techniques and design patterns to write  a fully functional app.
