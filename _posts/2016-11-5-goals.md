title: My goals as a Frontend Developer

---

Creating is a huge part of my life. When I found coding, my life opened up for the better. Seeing how programming is an art form and being able to create something that creates opportunities for others, or helps others find a partner, or simply for entertainment purposes brings me in to the world of developing everyday. But not only what we create brings me in. Being able to translate the technical side of these applications and programs to the english speaking language is also an art form. At first I did not know how or where to start, but my aspirations of wanting to help others and entertain was not going to stop me from learning what I need to know in order to bring my ideas to life. Twitch.tv is prime example of what I refer to when I speak of helping others and entertaining. Not only do they help people that are passionate about video games turn their hobby into a career, on a technical stand point they understand what it is that their users want to see. The video game industry is where I would like to start off my journey as a Web Developer whether is creating simple applications for users to start a new career, or create a community where people can hang out and network.
